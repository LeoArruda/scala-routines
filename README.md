# Scala and Spark Routines
Scala and Spark routines Training & Testing repository



## How to run the code
1. clone the repository
2. download the MovieLens 100K dataset from: [ http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
 ]
3. Unzip it, and move the resulting ml-100k folder into your scala-routines/data folder.
4. From IntelliJ welcome screen, select "Open or Import"


## Try it out

Expand the project’s tree view to show the scala-routines/src/main/scala/com.sundogsoftware.spark folder.

Right click on “HelloWorld” and select “Run HelloWorld”

You should see a message like:

**Hello world! The u.data file has 100000 lines.**

But, you might see a “class not found” error. If so, just quit IntelliJ, restart it, and try again. It’s just a bug in IntelliJ.
